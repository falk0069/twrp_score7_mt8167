# TWRP device tree for score 7 tablet (tb8167p3_bsp) and compiled image

My first attempt compiling TWRP for a Android device.  It is specifically for a Score 7 MediaTek (MT8167) device that is given to inmates and is heavily locked down.

v1.0.0 does not have the touchscreen working.  You need a microUSB mouse or an OTG adapter to use your standard USB mouse.  Device Info HW says the touchscreen driver is mtk-tpd, but I could not find them.
